Back in the days it was quite                 hard to watch inner properties of the smart contract or call its methods especially if contract’s                 creator didn’t verify its source on the Etherscan. So I decided to create simple yet effective tool                 myself.","It is able to deploy a new smart contract or inspect the existing one, generate transaction to sign                 later or right now, watch contract’s events, etc.","That project was my door to the world of modern web development, so its setup is very basic.                 Initially front-end was pure React and Ant Design UI components but later I rewrote                 it using Nextjs and Zustand state management. Smart contracts’ data is stored inside a                 browser’s local storage. I also used Storybook when writing my own components.","Back end is a simple Node.js-Express application that is used mostly for proxying the requests                 to third-party APIs.","Online version of the \"Imaginarium\" board game.","Here we decided to go with Vue on front-end with back-end based on Django.

During the development we used webpack dev server.","Back-end is represented by two servers, both implemented using Django: web server renders website                 pages, game server (Django+Redis) handles websockets, game logic and players actions.","Imaginarium online","T&D Beauty","Still in development","Web application for T&D Beauty - a beauty services aggregator.","My job was to implement almost all the front-end part - Nuxt setup, Vue components, HTML and                 CSS (actually SCSS) coding. ","It was one of the most interesting projects from the list due to variety of front-end                 fields to explore and integrate.","We needed server-side-rendering for SEO so Nuxt was obvious choice as we really like Vue.","Apart from login\u002Fpassword authorization we integrated several social networks using OAuth - Facebook                 and Google.

Smart contracts are organized into so called Storage\u002FLogic pattern to make upgrades easier.","All smart contracts are covered with Truffle unit tests.
